SCM-Project-PerfectWeight
Calculating the perfect weight is an essential step toward leading a healthier lifestyle. 
By understanding the ideal weight range based on a person's height, age, and body type, individuals can set realistic goals and make informed decisions about their diet and physical activity. 
This helps in preventing health risks associated with being underweight or overweight, such as heart disease, diabetes, and joint problems. 
The goal is not just to achieve a number, but to encourage users to adopt healthier habits, stay active, and maintain a balanced lifestyle for long-term well-being.
